## Motivation

When I got the idea for ConfTalks, I wrote down the problem I wanted to solve:

> When I (Eddy) am deciding if a conference is worth attending I usually check out the list of talks. I then decide which talks I'd like to see. Then I check YouTube to see if those talks are already uploaded. If the majority of the talks are recorded, then maybe it isn't worth going to the conference. Ideally there would be a website that can help find these talks. An index of conference talks that are already recorded and uploaded somewhere. You can bookmark talks so you can check up on them later to see if they have been uploaded already.

## Contributing

ConfTalks is open for contributions. A contribution can be anything like a feature or just some conference talks added to the JSON files in `/client/data`.

Please see the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/EddyVinck/ConfTalks/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
